### Top 3 Risks Observed (2-3 sentences each, in your own words)

1. - Missing Security Headers — Lack of CSP and HSTS. Mapped to OWASP A05:2025 — Security Misconfiguration. 

2. - Technology Stack Disclosure — `The X-Powered-By: Express header` reveals the backend framework to potential attackers. Mapped to OWASP A05:2025 — Security Misconfiguration.

3. - Unprotected API Endpoints — API requests to /reviews are processed without requiring any authentication or authorization. Mapped to OWASP A01:2025 — Broken Access Control.
