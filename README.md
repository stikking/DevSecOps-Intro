A hands-on elective course that teaches how to build a working DevSecOps program. You operate the same target — **OWASP Juice Shop** — across 10 weeks, applying a different defensive practice each lab: pre-commit secrets, signed commits, SBOM, SAST, DAST, IaC scanning, container hardening, supply-chain signing, runtime detection, and full-program triage in DefectDojo.

> *"Security is not a product, but a process."* — Bruce Schneier, *Secrets and Lies* (2000)

## Course Roadmap

The course follows a **map → discover → write → ship → scan → harden → sign → detect → triage** progression. Each week adds one defensive layer to the same Juice Shop target.

| 1 | Lab 1 | Foundations & SDLC | OWASP Top 10:2025, Juice Shop deploy, PR workflow |
| 2 | Lab 2 | Threat Modeling | STRIDE, DFDs, trust boundaries, Threagile YAML |
| 3 | Lab 3 | Secure Git | SSH commit signing, pre-commit gitleaks, history rewrite with `git filter-repo` |
| 4 | Lab 4 | SBOM + SCA | Syft (CycloneDX 1.6 + SPDX), Grype, Trivy, sign-ready attestations |
| 5 | Lab 5 | SAST + DAST | Semgrep (`p/owasp-top-ten`), ZAP baseline + authenticated, cross-tool correlation |

## The Project: OWASP Juice Shop

A deliberately-vulnerable web application maintained by Björn Kimminich since 2014; OWASP Flagship since 2018. The course pins **v20.0.0** (May 2026 release — Node 24, ~125 MB image, includes AI-themed prompt-injection challenges).

```

**You don't build the app; you make it secure.** Labs 2 (Threat Modeling), 6 (IaC), 11 (reverse proxy), and 12 (VM sandboxing) operate on adjacent scopes — playgrounds, model files, and infra — but Juice Shop is the thread connecting the others.

## Lectures + Readings

10 lectures, 17-25 slides each, 350-450 lines. Two readings replace lectures for the bonus labs.

## What Ships vs What Students Produce

The course repo ships **only** lab specs, lecture notes, and plumbing files. Students produce all their artifacts in their fork.

| Path | Ships in repo | Students produce |
|------|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| `lectures/` | ✅ | |
| `labs/labN.md` | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab2/threagile-model.yaml` — Threagile baseline | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab5/scripts/` — ZAP auth config + helper scripts | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab6/vulnerable-iac/` — TF/Pulumi/Ansible samples | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab9/manifests/`, `labs/lab9/policies/` — K8s + Rego starters | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab10/imports/` — DefectDojo importer | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab11/docker-compose.yml`, `labs/lab11/reverse-proxy/nginx.conf` | ✅ | |
| `labs/lab12/scripts/` — Kata install/configure | ✅ | |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — students write in Lab 1 | | ✅ |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` — students add from Lab 1 bonus onward | | ✅ |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — students write in Lab 3 | | ✅ |
| `labs/lab4/juice-shop.cdx.json` — SBOM regenerated each run | | ✅ (gitignored) |
| `labs/lab6/policies/my-custom-policy.yaml` — Lab 6 bonus | | ✅ |
| `labs/lab7/k8s/*.yaml` — hardened deployment | | ✅ |
| `labs/lab8/keys/cosign.pub` — public key (private gitignored) | | ✅ |
| `labs/lab9/falco/rules/custom-rules.yaml` | | ✅ |
| `submissions/labN.md` — lab reports, one per week | | ✅ |

The [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) keeps student-produced artifacts (`submissions/`, `.github/workflows/`, generated SBOMs, private keys, scan outputs) out of the course repo. Instructor-only reference submissions live in `refs/` and are also gitignored.

## Lab Structure

Each main lab (Labs 1-10) caps at **12 pts = 10 main + 2 bonus**.

| Task | Points | Description |
|------|-------:|-------------|
| **Task 1** | 6 pts | Core practice — advances the project; future labs depend on it. Required. |
| **Task 2** | 4 pts (3 in Lab 1) | Deeper dive into the week's topic. Skippable; project still works without it. |
| **Task 3** | 1 pt | *Lab 1 only* — GitHub community engagement. |
| **Bonus Task** | 2 pts | Extension for motivated students (flat 2 pts, not difficulty-weighted). |

A student who only completes Task 1 across all 10 labs ends with a working DevSecOps pipeline — just not all the deeper-dive controls.

**Bonus labs (11 + 12)** have a tighter shape: **Task 1 (4 pts) + Task 2 (4 pts) + Bonus Task (2 pts) = 10 pts total** (vs main labs' 12). The labs are bonus-track in the sense that they're not on the critical path; the Bonus Task inside each lab is still the genuinely-challenging extension. Bonus labs count toward a separate 20% weight (see grading below).

### Submission Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Fork Repo"] --> B["Create Branch<br/>feature/labN"]
    B --> C["Complete Tasks"]
    C --> D["Write<br/>submissions/labN.md"]
    D --> E["Push & Open PR"]
    E --> F["Submit PR URL<br/>via Moodle"]
    F --> G["Receive Feedback"]

    style A fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style E fill:#F44336,color:#fff
    style F fill:#00BCD4,color:#fff
```

Submissions are **CLI output + brief analysis**, not source code. Paste the commands you ran and what they printed; answer the questions at the end of each task in 2-3 sentences.

## Grading

Five components. Their max contributions sum to **139%** but the grade is **capped at 100%** — multiple paths to A; no single mandatory path.

| Component | Raw Points | Weight | What it rewards |
|-----------|-----------:|-------:|-----------------|
| **Main labs 1-10** (Task 1 + Task 2 + Task 3 where applicable) | 100 | **70%** | Diligent project work — the floor for any serious student |
| **Bonus tasks 1-10** (2 pts each, flat — no difficulty weighting) | 20 | **14%** | Going above and beyond on weekly topics |
| **Quiz leaderboards** (5 rolling per-2-labs leaderboards, top-10 share 1% pool each) | — | **up to 5%** | Engagement + excellence; rewards late-joining students too |
| **Bonus labs 11 + 12** (Task 1 + Task 2 + Bonus = 10 pts each) | 20 | **20%** | Edge hardening + VM-backed isolation |
| **Final exam** | — | **30%** | Optional path — written, comprehensive |
| **Sum (capped at 100%)** | | **139%** | |

### Paths to A

Two real paths to A (≥90%):

- **Practice path:** all main labs + bonuses + both bonus labs → ≥90%. No exam required.
- **Exam path:** all main labs + bonuses + decent exam → ≥90%. No bonus labs required.

Sample scores:

| Profile | Main | Bonuses | Bonus labs | Exam | Quiz | Total |
|---------|-----:|--------:|-----------:|-----:|-----:|------:|
| All Task 1 only | 42% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **42%** |
| All Task 1+2, no bonuses | 70% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **70%** |
| Add all weekly bonuses | 70% | 14% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **84%** |
| + good quiz | 70% | 14% | 0% | 0% | 5% | **89%** ← *just short of A* |
| + finish one bonus lab | 70% | 14% | 10% | 0% | 5% | **99%** ← *A territory* |
| + both bonus labs | 70% | 14% | 20% | 0% | 5% | **100%** (capped) |
| Take the exam instead | 70% | 14% | 0% | 25% | 5% | **100%** (capped) |

**The deliberate design:** `Main + lab-bonuses + quiz` alone tops out at **89% → just short of A**. To earn A you must do at least one bonus lab OR the exam. Stops "easy A from quiz padding."

### Quiz leaderboards (the 5%)

Five rolling windows, one per pair of labs:

| Window | Labs covered |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | labs 1-2 |
| 2 | labs 3-4 |
| 3 | labs 5-6 |
| 4 | labs 7-8 |
| 5 | labs 9-10 |

Each window allocates a **1% pool** to its top 10 students. Late-joiners can still rank in later windows without being structurally disadvantaged.

### Performance tiers

| Grade | Range | Required to reach |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **A** | 90-100 | All main labs + at least one of: bonus labs / exam |
| **B** | 75-89 | Main labs + most bonuses, no extension work |
| **C** | 60-74 | Main lab Task 1 across most labs |
| **D** | 0-59 | Below expectations |

### Late submissions

Max 6/12 per lab if submitted within 1 week of deadline. No credit after 1 week.

## Course Completion

By Week 10 you'll have:

- A working DevSecOps pipeline operating against OWASP Juice Shop with controls at pre-commit, build, deploy, and runtime
- A DefectDojo instance with all prior labs' findings deduped + triaged under an SLA matrix
- A 5-minute interview walkthrough script you can use in DevSecOps job interviews
- If you did the bonus labs: a production-grade Nginx reverse-proxy config + first-hand experience with VM-backed container sandboxing

**This is exactly the portfolio you'd walk through in a DevSecOps interview** — see the 5-minute walkthrough script in `submissions/lab10-walkthrough.md` (produced in Lab 10 bonus).
